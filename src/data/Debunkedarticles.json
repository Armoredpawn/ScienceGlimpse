        "content": "It’s 10:59 o’clock at night, and the air seems to be coated in silence. You count—1…2…3…4 — each number sending shivers of anticipation down your spine. Every tick of the clock stretches time; your heart races with delight.\n\nEverything is picture-perfect. An array of snacks awaits you on the table, the TV glows mutely, and your blanket wraps around you like a cocoon.\n\n56…57...58…59, and then the clock chimes. You swivel your head to the TV, eyes wide as the “New episodes” button pops up on the screen.\n\nThe new season of Ninjago has finally arrived\n\nYou reach for the remote, but clench empty air. You look around wildly, heart sinking, until you see it at the edge of the sofa — Just a sliver away. Every muscle tenses. Your hand outstretched, you imagine bending reality, summoning every ounce of your brain to make it levitate toward you. But it stays there, placid, indifferent, unmoving\n\nAnd at that moment, your greatest wish is that you were a psychic.\n\nA common myth is that “humans only utilize about 10% of their brains. So-called “psychics” or individuals with supposed supernatural abilities are often credited with having unlocked the rest of the 90%, allowing them to perform acts usually considered impossible. This idea has fostered books, movies, and even real-life pursuits, with some people spending their entire lives trying to achieve this state through extensive research, performance enhancers, and meditation.\n\nBut reality is far less mystical —and far more mesmerizing. Neuroscientists have already explored this question in incredible detail. The truth is, humans use 100% of their brains even in the simplest of tasks. The act of picking up a cup activates motor regions, sensory pathways, and coordination centers —lighting up far more than a fraction of the brain. And that’s just for something as ordinary as lifting a cup of water.\n\nIn more complex tasks — playing sports, solving math problems, or creating art — brain activity goes into hyperdrive. Multiple regions fire in complex patterns, weaving thought, memory, and motion into a seamless action. Forget leaving 90% of our brains silent; even our everyday lives require the full orchestration of the human brain!\n\nFor those who fall into the 10% myth, the reason is often pop culture, books, and movies fantasizing about surreal power — telekinesis, perfect memory, superhuman intelligence, or even psychic abilities. These surreal abilities lure people into believing what usually would be considered ridiculous.\n\nThis belief has led some to spend years chasing a nonexistent high. Meditation, drugs, extensive counseling, and so-called performance enhancers are often framed as ways to “unlock” the rest of the human brain capacity. But once again, the truth is very different. Even though practices like meditation and yoga don’t reveal hidden brainpower, they DO provide other benefits that can lead to better productivity and mental health, such as stress reduction, improved focus, and better regulation of emotions. Performance enhancers, on the other hand, don’t just magically unlock the rest of your brain. They use the same portion of the brain but temporarily alter the brain’s chemistry — boosting alertness, reducing fatigue, or enhancing reaction time — often at the cost of long-term side effects.\n\nNow, if these facts are there, then why do people still fall into this trap? The lure stems from social media. Often, popular apps such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube endorse these wondrous effects. Many of the individuals on these apps either do it for views or are extremely misinformed, often only learning a small portion of the bigger picture that conforms to their beliefs.  Psychologically, people believe this due to their deep desire for potential. Humans love the idea that we are just one secret away from greatness, and that the human limit isn’t capped. The myth gives people hope that something magical is waiting —even if science tells a very different story.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t the only fantasy people fall for due to this craving. Other examples include\n\n·         Hidden Sixth Sense – Many people believe there exists a dormant extra sense that some people have to in greater extent than others. In reality, it’s just our other senses adapting along with our brains, giving us a false “sixth sense”\n\n·         Unused Muscles – The claim that humans only use a fraction of our muscular strength, and if fully unlocked , some could even lift bulldozers. While it’s partially true that our brain limits our raw strength to protect the body from extra injury, we use far more than the myth suggests.\n\n·         Dreams hold secrets – Many inaccurately theorize that dreams are secret messages about the future, when in fact, even though dreams can reflect emotional states and memories, they don’t blueprint the future.\n\nAt their core, all these myths hook us the same way: they whisper that this isn’t our limit and that we are more than we appear to be. The right switch, pill, or practice will take us beyond what we are now.\n\nBut these myths go past just fun romanization of life, and seep into something much more dangerous. Many waste their entire lives chasing the unreachable, spending millions of dollars, and investing in fake products. Online, products like brain enhancement pills (pills claiming to give genius-level focus and brainpower) or Binaural beats apps (boasting audio frequencies that will “unlock” the other 90%) all promise the same, easy way out of work. Claiming that their product is the answer, for astonishing amounts of money, for a simple product that only provides the illusion of increased intellect.\nEven worse, some of these products are outright dangerous, and neglect to include these ads or promotions.\n\n In a huge event where a drug called piracetam was advertised as one of these so-called “smart drugs,” disastrous consequences followed. Originally, piracetam was prescribed in small amounts for memory loss, dementia, and learning problems, but in large quantities, this drug can do more harm than good. Side effects such as trouble sleeping, anxiety, depression, or drowsiness plagued buyers of this drug, causing many cases of hospitalization.\nAfter further digging, it was found that large amounts of this drug, in unsafe amounts, were illegally being sold without FDA approval. The operation took years to shut down, and even to this day, people continue to fall for these tricks.\nThis incident is just one of the hundreds of incidents involving a falsely advertised drug. Taking advantage of human greed, sellers rake in millions off these products, while buyers are left with nothing except ruined lives.\nTo avoid these malicious products, follow these steps –\n·         Check regulations – Only buy FDA-approved products or another trusted medical authority\n·         Ask a doctor – Never buy a marketed drug without asking a certified doctor, ESPECIALLY if it’s marketed as a performance enhancer\n·         Trust your gut – Remember, if it’s too good to be true, then it most likely isn’t true!\n·         No cutting corners – Sleep, exercise, a balanced diet, and meditation work just as well, if not better. Don’t take the easy way out with a magical pill!\n \nNow, there you are again, stretching your hand, desperately wishing you could simply make the remote levitate towards you. A bead of sweat slowly forms on your forehead, eyes burning with focus, and you twitch slightly.\n\nTHERE IT WAS! Did it just move a little?! It seems to be shifted a bit towards the right!\n\nDespite your overactive imagination, you sigh, getting out of your warm fortress, trudging to the remote, with a lingering feeling of disappointment.\n\nMaybe psychics weren’t real after all.\n\nBut at least reality had Netflix."
