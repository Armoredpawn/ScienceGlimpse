        "content": "Just like many others, I spent my childhood gazing up at the glittering sky — full of stars, constellations, and planets. Back then, I believed space was perfect: ideal, beautiful, and unblemished… until I learned about a terrifying stain. \n\nInvisible, ravenous beasts that would consume anything daring enough to cross their path. \n\nCreatures straight out of science fiction — but frighteningly real. \n\nThe monsters of the cosmos. \n\nThe fallen stars. \n\nThe devourers of light. \n\nBlack Holes. \n\nThe paradoxes of nature itself, black holes, are shrouded in more than just darkness. The mystery of these monsters started with a simple equation and led to the discovery of seemingly missing patches of space. To this day, these gaping voids confound the minds of even the greatest physicists with the innocent yet cruel question: What are black holes— and how exactly are they created? \n\nBlack holes, despite their name, aren’t holes at all. Their tremendously dense remnants are left behind from collapsed stars. A star is created when its core’s gravity draws together enough dust and gases to ignite nuclear fusion. This reaction generates incredible amounts of energy, heating up the material and causing it to expand outwards. The result is a constant battle with the gravity of the star’s core, which greedily pulls it in, and the matter, which makes every effort to break for. \n\nImagine a balloon where the air desperately attempts to escape the rubber skin that continuously pulls it back in. Inevitably, when the fuel for nuclear fusion runs out, the star has no more energy to expand outwards and collapses in on its core. \n\nIn the case of extremely massive stars, known as high-mass stars, the star goes through a reaction known as a supernova that causes all the matter to explode outwards, leaving the core alone in space. Now, if a particularly massive star—more than 25 times the mass of our Sun —collapses, the core that is left behind is so dense that its gravity doesn’t allow even light to escape its clutches. \n\nThus, a black hole is born. \n\nAfter the birth of a black hole, the surrounding space falls into turmoil. The black hole’s gravity draws in surrounding matter, as well as light, creating a dark, seemingly empty patch of space. Most of the matter that is drawn in starts spiraling into the black hole, creating a hot, glowing disk of debris, dust, gases, and other matter, known as an accretion disk. Because black holes emit no light and draw in any form of electromagnetic radiation, these disks are the only way scientists can detect them. As these disks orbit the black hole, they heat up to millions of degrees, making them glow and emit various types of radiation, unveiling the location of these otherwise undetectable chasms. \n\nA common question is what would happen to any object—or person—unfortunate enough to fall into a black hole’s gravitational field. Firstly, as the object approaches the event horizon, time starts behaving strangely. The event horizon is ominously, yet fittingly named the point of no return, and isn’t a physical surface but rather a boundary in the spherical space of the black hole where anything, not even light, can escape due to the intense gravity (Note: gravity increases the closer you get to an object). Near this edge, the gravity of the black hole starts causing something known as gravitational time dilation: A drastic slowing of time when compared to a distant observer. For the object inside the gravitational field, time would slow down so significantly that mere minutes would correspond to centuries for any distant bystander. This phenomenon only grows as a person nears the core of the black hole, otherwise known as the singularity. \n\nIn addition to time dilation, the object would also experience spaghettification — a dramatic stretching caused by the intense gravitational disbalance near a black hole. The side closer to the singularity would experience a significantly stronger gravitational pull than the side further away, creating an effect so powerful it would stretch the object into a long, thin strand — like spaghetti. \n\nNow, one of the greatest mysteries of black holes is the nature of their cores, known as singularities. These singularities compress a finite amount of mass into an infinitely small space. Around these cores, the laws of classical physics and quantum mechanics, as we know, cease to function in predictable or logical ways. \n\nThis breakdown challenges many scientific equations, with one of the notable ones being the equation E=mc2. This equation, created by the genius Albert Einstein, relates an object’s mass to energy. If one were to naïvely substitute in the infinite density of a singularity in place of mass, the solution would imply infinite energy — something forbidden in the framework of physics. \n\nThis paradox provides a glimpse of the strange nature of singularities and indicates the need for a unified theory that can balance physics with the existence of black holes. \n\nA key step in solving these mysteries and logical flaws stems from directly observing black holes. As mentioned before, since black holes do not emit light or any form of electromagnetic radiation, traditional means of observation yield no results. Instead, scientists carefully detect the radiation released from the accretion disks, or the large gravitational waves that are released during the collision of two black holes — a phenomenon first confirmed by LIGO (a large-scale physics observatory designed to detect gravitational waves) in 2015. \n\nThese observations have revealed that black holes come in various sizes: \n\n· Stellar (3-100 solar masses) * \n\n· Intermediate (hundreds-thousands of solar masses) \n\n· Supermassive (millions to billions of solar masses) \n\n· Primordial (hypothetical remnants from the Big Bang). \n\n* 1 solar mass = 1.989×1030 kg \n\nThis wide variety of sizes leads scientists to believe black holes grow through various processes. The current leading theories involve either the black hole drawing in surrounding matter or merging with other black holes. While these ideas hold up when tested with models and indirect observations, a clear explanation still eludes physicists. \n\nA more mystifying theory comes from the famous scientist Stephen Hawking, who theorized in 1974 that black holes may not only grow, but also decay. This is possible through something known as Hawking Radiation, an occurrence where black holes create virtual particle pairs at the edge of their event horizon, due to quantum fluctuations. One of these particles falls into the singularity, while the other escapes as radiation, causing the black hole to shrink in size. This brings about the prospect that over an extended period, a black hole could potentially disappear. \n\nThe idea that something as immense and powerful as a black hole could vanish challenges our understanding of not only these abysses but also our understanding of the universe itself. It raises more questions than it answers that remain hidden from our senses, yet illuminated by the divine vision of mathematics, the language of the universe. \n\nAnd even then, these questions only scratch the surface of secrets these voids hide. \n\nOther notions—information paradox, the breakdown of quantum physics around singularities, or white holes, the opposite twins of black holes—continue to humble scientists, reminding us about how much we still have left to unveil. \n\nThese dark, mysterious, and terrifying enigmas test the limits of what we know, tugging at the very fabric of time, space, and reality as we know it. \n\nWe may never truly understand these cosmic chasms. \n\nBut we can try."

        "content": "Every time Netflix suggests your next binge, or your phone predicts the next word you are about to type, you're seeing machine learning in action. \n\nMachine learning is often a foreign concept to many, yet it is integrated into numerous applications we use daily. Various social media platforms, videos on YouTube, and even products on Amazon utilize machine learning. This subset of artificial intelligence has quietly positioned itself close into the center of our lives, enabling us to interact with it daily.\n\nThe realm of artificial intelligence includes numerous subfields, one of which being machine learning. Machine learning allows systems to actually learn patterns and correlations from data and make predictions and decisions based on what they receive. Machine learning can be used to analyze huge amounts of data to determine patterns or trends in an extremely short amount of time - in fact, the more amount of data the machine learning algorithm contains, the more likely its accuracy will increase. \n\nMachine learning is a learning process that is achieved through the implementation of machine learning models. These models are no more than mathematical formulas - usually complex ones which we don’t need to delve into. These models analyze large amounts of data to improve their prediction accuracy and performance over time without being explicitly programmed. A simple way to think about it is this: imagine a scenario where a small child must classify planes and cars. Rather than just instructing the child that planes have wings, a long body, a tail, and can fly, while cars are much smaller, have no wings or tail, and do not fly, the child is instead given hundreds or thousands of images of either cars or planes. Over time, as the amount of data grows, the child is able to recognize and detect these differences between the car and the plane. This is the heart of machine learning. The ML models learn from the data they’re given through two main learning processes. \n\nThe first method is supervised learning. In this method of learning, all of the data contains labels. Going back to the car vs. plane example, if a ML model was given this data and told to analyze it with supervised learning, all of the data would contain labels, such as “car” or “plane.” The model is able to easily identify which picture is a car or plane based on the label and, through this, is able to detect any differences between the car and the plane and classify accordingly. Numerous practical applications exist for this method of learning for ML models, including medical diagnosis, fraud detection, marketing, and more. \n\nThe second method is through unsupervised learning, which is the exact opposite of supervised learning. In unsupervised learning, labels do not exist for the data - indicating that when the data is passed to the model, the model does not know the labels. The ML model must be able to detect any hidden patterns, correlations, or relationships without any prior experience or examples. Imagine an adult working to analyze consumer spending behaviors. This adult mainly specializes in finding sets of items that are bought together or occur frequently together in consumer purchases. The adult would be that, the majority of the time, consumers buy bread and butter together at the store. Obviously, the relationships that must be determined are much more complex than the one just given - or else why would one need this learning method of machine learning? In this method, the model teaches itself the similarities, differences, and groupings within the dataset. Applications for this method of machine learning include clustering of people based on their types of behavior in different situations (e.g. purchasing, panic, etc.), aiding in customer segmentation for businesses, along with detections in cybersecurity, and even genomic data analysis. \n\nNow, ML models operate through a series of layers containing neurons. The first layer, called the input layer, receives the data. Through this data, the machine learning process is initialized. Next, the model contains one or more hidden layers, which is where core learning and pattern extraction occurs. The more hidden layers a ML model has, the “smarter” it becomes, allowing it to better extrapolate relationships in the data given in the input layer. A model with 10 hidden layers would be able to find distinct correlations in the data much better than a model with only one input layer. However, this model will also run slower than a model with 1 hidden layer due to an increase in training time. Finally, the last layer is the output layer, which consists of the model’s prediction on the data initially given in the input layer. \n\nModels usually operate on training and testing data. To provide accurate results, it is essential that the testing portion is wholly different from the training portion. During the training portion, the data enters the input layer and passes through the hidden layer. In the output layer, models incorporate a loss function. In this step, the loss function measures the model’s predictions against the actual value in supervised learning, while in unsupervised learning, the loss function measures how well the model was able to extrapolate relationships and correlations in the data. Based on these results, the model updates the hidden layer accordingly in order to improve its results on the next portion of the training dataset. \n\nThe testing portion includes data being passed through the input layer and analyzed by the hidden layer. This step is crucial as the training of the hidden layer functions indicate how well the model is able to detect relationships and make predictions on the data. Finally, a prediction is passed through the output layer. \n\nML models are not always 100% accurate - in fact they often are never 100% accurate. To achieve this accuracy, models must be completely right, which means that their hidden layer must be perfect. This is not always the case. To improve accuracy, one must have lots of data in order for the functions in the hidden layer to adjust themselves in the training phase, along with lots of hidden layers as well. By including these features, one can easily improve the accuracy of a ML model. \n\nMachine learning is no longer a futuristic concept - it’s currently being utilized by companies, organizations and researchers across the globe and has already positioned itself in the midst of our everyday lives. Amazon is able to push products towards us through these models, using our previous purchase history as the data. Most importantly, they are able to do this without any human intervention, highlighting the goal of building systems that can adapt and improve on their own. Even without labeled data, ML models are still able to detect anomalies and relationships in data. However, although ML may sound powerful, it is critical to understand its limitations and drawbacks as well. The utilization of machine learning wisely and efficiently is the future of our community.

        "content": "Every second, billions of invisible transformations are happening all around you — rust spreads across metal, bread rises in the oven, and the air you breathe changes with every exhale. \n\nChemical reactions are all around us. They’ve been occurring long before humans were created, long before even the earth existed. Ever seen iron rusting? That’s a chemical reaction. Tried mixing vinegar and baking soda together and seeing fizzing and bubbling? That’s also a chemical reaction. These reactions have been occurring for eternity and us humans have extracted various laws and principles governing these reactions. \n\nHave you ever seen a chemical reaction? Like H(g) + I(s) → HI(g)? If not, this is the notation for the reaction between hydrogen and iodine that creates hydrogen iodide. Essentially, a chemical reaction is the process of one or more substances chemically changing into another substance. Water freezing wouldn’t be a chemical change since the atoms making up the ice are still H2O - they’re just in a different form. However, iron rusting would be considered a chemical change as the chemical composition (which refers to which atoms are present) is different once the reaction is complete. In a chemical reaction, the substances on the left are called reactants, while the substances formed on the right are called products. \n\nNow, metals, since they have electrons to lose, tend to react with nonmetals, since nonmetals tend to gain electrons. This reaction forms an ionic bond between the two elements. An ionic bond is formed from the transferring of electrons. An example of an ionic bond would be NaCl(s). Sodium has 1 extra electron it would like to give away, while chlorine has 1 electron it would like to gain. As a result, these two elements form an ionic bond with each other. Ionic bonds tend to be extremely strong and brittle. They are almost always made of metals and nonmentals. \n\nHowever, elements and substances can often share electrons amongst themselves as well in order to maintain balance in their electron structure. These types of bonds are called covalent bonds and usually form between nonmetals. An example would be carbon dioxide, or CO2. Carbon and oxygen share their electrons in order to maintain stability. Covalent bonds are typically weaker than ionic bonds but are still strong nonetheless. \n\nAs the strength of the atomic bonds increases, substances tend to exist in solid or liquid states at room temperature because stronger bonds hold particles closely together. Conversely, weaker bonds or interactions result in substances that are more likely to be gases, as the particles do not stick together strongly and can move freely. \n\nNow, however, what you’ve been assuming now is that the substances making up the reactants of the reaction will always react when close together - but this is not the case for a myriad of reactions. Often, favorable reactions may display this phenomenon, but on the other hand, some reactions may need energy in order to complete. This classifies a reaction as either endothermic or exothermic. \n\nEndothermic reactions tend to require energy in order to start the reaction. The additional energy will cause the particles to collide with each other more frequently and, as a result, participate in the reaction. Endothermic reactions tend to be unfavorable. Energy may be released at the end of the reaction but that energy never crosses the initial amount of energy needed to be put in. \n\nThe exact opposite of an endothermic reaction is an exothermic reaction, which tends to release large amounts of energy after the reaction has gone to completion. These reactions tend to be hugely favorable since more energy is released when the reaction is complete. However, this doesn’t mean that no energy is required to get the reaction running - it just means that the energy released from the reaction is larger than the amount of energy put into the reaction. \n\nIn short, just by physically mixing two things together does not mean a reaction occurs. But how do we know how much energy to put in? Well, chemists have a name for this one as well. Its name is called the activation energy. The activation energy details how much energy to put in to get a reaction going. This value is different for each and every reaction as each reaction is different. A reaction can only go to completion once the activation energy is met-  or else it will not run. \n\nNow, on the other side of the reaction, where the products form, you may also be thinking that once a reaction occurs, only products will be left over. But, since science can sometimes be tricky, this is not always the case either in some reactions. \n\nWhen reactions start, they have a rate of formation of products. It could be that they’re forming products at a rate of 5 milligrams per second, or 500 grams per minute. This rate of reaction determines how long it takes for a reaction to complete. Some reactions require less than a second, while others may require years, and possibly even thousands and millions of years as well. An example would be the decay of xenon, which takes half a trillion times longer to complete than the age of the universe. \n\nAlso, many reactions don’t simply go one way. As products form, sometimes they react back to create the original reactants. This back-and-forth continues until the reaction reaches a balance called chemical equilibrium, where reactants and products coexist in stable amounts. This means that the reactants and products actually coexist together. But how do people actually determine how much is present at equilibrium? \n\nWell, they use K, the universal equilibrium constant. The value of K is different for every reaction and details the extent to which a reaction will proceed by indicating the ratio of products and reactants at equilibrium. Some reactants, when mixed together, go to completion and only the products are left. These reactions, however, do not go to completion, and when equilibrium is established, there are still both reactants and products remaining. A higher value of K indicates a high level of completion, as there are more products than reactants. A low value of K indicates that the concentration of the reactants is higher than the concentration of products. A value of 1 for K signifies that the concentration of products and reactants at equilibrium is equal. \n\nAn example of a reaction involving equilibrium is the formation of nitrogen monoxide, from O2(g)+N2(g)⇌ 2NO(g). The double arrow indicates an equilibrium reaction. For this reaction, oxygen, nitrogen, and nitrogen monoxide are present at equilibrium. \n\nChemical reactions are far more than just things mixing in a beaker — they are dynamic processes that shape everything from the air we breathe to the fuel that powers our lives. Whether fast or slow, simple or complex, reactions follow clear principles: they occur at specific rates, often reach equilibrium, and are governed by the conservation of mass and energy. \n\nUnderstanding how and why reactions happen gives us the power to design better medicines, cleaner energy sources, and smarter technologies. In the end, to study chemistry is to understand the invisible forces constantly at work in the universe, subsequently transforming matter, releasing energy, and sustaining life itself."

        "content": "Back when I was seven years old, I was fully convinced that a ghost was haunting my house. No, I never saw this ghost, but I knew it existed. Whether it was the whispering creak of the floor, ominous shadows that pranced inside my room, or even the soft thumping knocks on my door, the ghost was keeping me on my toes. The fact that I hadn’t seen this ghost yet terrified me, and infuriated my mom till the end. Her reasoning was always, “If you can’t see it, then how do you even know it’s there?” Back then, this argument usually sent me back upstairs, attempting, in vain, to fall back asleep. \n\nBut now, if my mom were to ask me this question (hypothetically, of course, because obviously I’m still not frightened by Hollowface, definitely not), I would most likely rebut by explaining that, if scientists had followed her logic, then we would still only have seven planets in our solar system— not eight. \n\nNeptune wasn’t discovered by coincidence— in fact, it wasn’t even initially discovered through direct observation using a telescope. The first-time scientists predicted Neptune’s existence in the 1800s was through rigorous math, an incredible breakthrough in the way we thought about the universe, but not extremely complicated when broken down. \n\nWhen a planet orbits the Sun, scientists can predict its exact orbital path using its mass, distance from the Sun, and proximity to other large objects (other objects’ gravitational force would pull the planet towards them, barely, slightly altering the orbital path). When scientists observed the orbit of Uranus, the seventh planet from the sun, they discovered a slight variation in the orbital path from what was predicted on paper. \n\nThe only plausible explanation for this would be the existence of another planet— about 17 times the mass of the Earth— that was pulling Uranus towards it, therefore altering its path around the Sun from what was theorized. \n\nThrough Newton’s laws and careful math, even though scientists couldn’t see this new planet, they knew it must exist. In 1846, the genius French mathematician, Urbain Le Verrier, calculated the approximate mass, position, and orbital path of this ghost planet. His predictions were so precise that he was able to give the astronomers at the Berlin observatory exact coordinates to the planet’s location in the sky. That night, when they swiveled their telescopes to his calculated point, they discovered that his coordinates were only off by a minuscule 1 degree, leading to the discovery of the eighth planet— Neptune, the ice giant. \n\nThis discovery gave us more than just a new planet to add to the poster site. It was the first time a celestial object had been found without direct observation— and proved that even unseen forces, like gravity, could be predicted by the vision of mathematics. \n\nAfter this revelation, scientists in the early 1900s also discovered deviations in the orbit of Neptune. Now that the scientists had a well-thought-out process, they were able to calculate the position of the ninth planet quickly. In 1930, a young astronomer named Clyde Tombaugh compared photographs of the night sky and discovered a faint, moving object— Pluto. \n\nThe funny part about this entire episode is that it was completely incorrect. It turns out that since Pluto is only 0.2% of the mass of Earth, its gravity wouldn’t have been able to be observed in or even affect Neptune’s orbit at all! The reason scientists believed that there was a deviation from its predicted path was due to observational errors coming from the satellite Voyager 2, not due to a huge planet that would tug on its orbit. That’s why the position of Pluto in Clyde’s photos didn’t match the predicted position— because Pluto’s gravitational field was too small to affect Neptune at all. In the end, Pluto’s discovery was due to a happy coincidence. \n\nAfter Pluto’s unfortunate ejection from planet status (now known as a dwarf planet), for years it has been accepted that there are only eight planets in the solar system— Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune…that is, up until now. \n\nRecently, scientists have noticed that objects in the Kuiper belt (KBO for short), an asteroid belt beyond the orbit of Neptune containing many icy bodies and dwarf planets (like Pluto), have been behaving strangely. Not only are their orbits offset from what is predicted, but they seem to be shepherding around a large object— even larger than Neptune. \n\nDue to this object’s distance from Neptune, it does not affect Neptune’s orbit despite its large size. In models and trails, a Ninth Phantom Planet would perfectly explain the irregularities in the orbits of the objects in the KBO. Other predictions, such as observational errors— like what happened with Pluto, a passing star affecting their orbit, or a large clustering of smaller objects that is creating a large gravitational field have been predicted, but so far, the most plausible explanation revolves around two leading theories. \n\nOne theory suggests the existence of a ninth planet that we haven’t been able to observe yet. The reason for this may revolve around its distance from Earth, which would make it appear incredibly dim; it may lie within a dense star field, making it hard to distinguish from other objects; or current telescopes may lack the required sensitivity or field of vision to spot such a slow-moving object. Despite these speculations, scientists still have no clear idea of why we haven’t been able to observe it yet. \n\nThe second theory is significantly more spine-tingling— the possibility of a black hole lurking within the Kuiper belt. This hypothetical black hole would only be the size of an apple, but still have an incredible gravitational pull— comparable to a huge planet. Luckily, this black hole wouldn’t cause much trouble for us due to its relatively miniscule size and distance from Earth, but it could throw the KMO in a state of disorder, causing some to bodies to be thrown off orbit and go careening into deep space; increase collisions inside the KBO; and potentially, if leading theories about black holes expanding through matter consumption are true, start growing large enough to affect Neptune. Once again, it’s extremely fortunate for us that even if this were true, it would take billions upon billions of years to accomplish, since the small size of KBO objects would prove too tiny for it to make any notable growth. \n\nAstronomers like Dr. Konstantin Batygin and Dr. Mike Brown— who first proposed Planet Nine— are collaborating with international teams using advanced observatories such as the Subaru Telescope atop Mauna Kea, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). They’re running massive computer simulations and carefully tracking orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects to narrow down where this mystery planet could be located. Every small shift in an asteroid’s orbit, every tiny gravitational oddity, every subtle distortion of an object, leads us one step closer to unveiling this enigma. \n\nThe discovery of this new object would serve as more than just another planet to add to solar system charts, but would force us to dig more deeply into the story of our universe. We’d gain clues on how outer planets are formed, why the Kuiper belt is shaped the way it is, and whether our solar system has had encounters with other stars in the past. It could even be the missing page that allows us to open a new chapter in our book of cosmic history. \n\nGoing back to my childhood delusions, even though I couldn’t see this ghost, in my head, all signs pointed to the fact that it was alive. Every creak, knock, and shadow just seemed like further evidence to solidify the fact that I was being haunted. Even though my mother’s question, “If you can’t see it, how do you know it’s there?” seemed so irrefutable at the time. But this same question has driven generations of scientists to look past the visible and into the unknown. \n\nIf we can detect a planet without seeing it, if using mathematics, we can map the pull of something beyond what we can observe…then what else could be out there? \n\nWhispering through the vacuum of space. \n\nDropping clues on its subtle existence. \n\nInvisible yet undeniable. \n\nWaiting."
