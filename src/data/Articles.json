        "content": "Just like many others, I spent my childhood gazing up at the glittering sky — full of stars, constellations, and planets. Back then, I believed space was perfect: ideal, beautiful, and unblemished… until I learned about a terrifying stain. \n\nInvisible, ravenous beasts that would consume anything daring enough to cross their path. \n\nCreatures straight out of science fiction — but frighteningly real. \n\nThe monsters of the cosmos. \n\nThe fallen stars. \n\nThe devourers of light. \n\nBlack Holes. \n\nThe paradoxes of nature itself, black holes, are shrouded in more than just darkness. The mystery of these monsters started with a simple equation and led to the discovery of seemingly missing patches of space. To this day, these gaping voids confound the minds of even the greatest physicists with the innocent yet cruel question: What are black holes— and how exactly are they created? \n\nBlack holes, despite their name, aren’t holes at all. Their tremendously dense remnants are left behind from collapsed stars. A star is created when its core’s gravity draws together enough dust and gases to ignite nuclear fusion. This reaction generates incredible amounts of energy, heating up the material and causing it to expand outwards. The result is a constant battle with the gravity of the star’s core, which greedily pulls it in, and the matter, which makes every effort to break for. \n\nImagine a balloon where the air desperately attempts to escape the rubber skin that continuously pulls it back in. Inevitably, when the fuel for nuclear fusion runs out, the star has no more energy to expand outwards and collapses in on its core. \n\nIn the case of extremely massive stars, known as high-mass stars, the star goes through a reaction known as a supernova that causes all the matter to explode outwards, leaving the core alone in space. Now, if a particularly massive star—more than 25 times the mass of our Sun —collapses, the core that is left behind is so dense that its gravity doesn’t allow even light to escape its clutches. \n\nThus, a black hole is born. \n\nAfter the birth of a black hole, the surrounding space falls into turmoil. The black hole’s gravity draws in surrounding matter, as well as light, creating a dark, seemingly empty patch of space. Most of the matter that is drawn in starts spiraling into the black hole, creating a hot, glowing disk of debris, dust, gases, and other matter, known as an accretion disk. Because black holes emit no light and draw in any form of electromagnetic radiation, these disks are the only way scientists can detect them. As these disks orbit the black hole, they heat up to millions of degrees, making them glow and emit various types of radiation, unveiling the location of these otherwise undetectable chasms. \n\nA common question is what would happen to any object—or person—unfortunate enough to fall into a black hole’s gravitational field. Firstly, as the object approaches the event horizon, time starts behaving strangely. The event horizon is ominously, yet fittingly named the point of no return, and isn’t a physical surface but rather a boundary in the spherical space of the black hole where anything, not even light, can escape due to the intense gravity (Note: gravity increases the closer you get to an object). Near this edge, the gravity of the black hole starts causing something known as gravitational time dilation: A drastic slowing of time when compared to a distant observer. For the object inside the gravitational field, time would slow down so significantly that mere minutes would correspond to centuries for any distant bystander. This phenomenon only grows as a person nears the core of the black hole, otherwise known as the singularity. \n\nIn addition to time dilation, the object would also experience spaghettification — a dramatic stretching caused by the intense gravitational disbalance near a black hole. The side closer to the singularity would experience a significantly stronger gravitational pull than the side further away, creating an effect so powerful it would stretch the object into a long, thin strand — like spaghetti. \n\nNow, one of the greatest mysteries of black holes is the nature of their cores, known as singularities. These singularities compress a finite amount of mass into an infinitely small space. Around these cores, the laws of classical physics and quantum mechanics, as we know, cease to function in predictable or logical ways. \n\nThis breakdown challenges many scientific equations, with one of the notable ones being the equation E=mc2. This equation, created by the genius Albert Einstein, relates an object’s mass to energy. If one were to naïvely substitute in the infinite density of a singularity in place of mass, the solution would imply infinite energy — something forbidden in the framework of physics. \n\nThis paradox provides a glimpse of the strange nature of singularities and indicates the need for a unified theory that can balance physics with the existence of black holes. \n\nA key step in solving these mysteries and logical flaws stems from directly observing black holes. As mentioned before, since black holes do not emit light or any form of electromagnetic radiation, traditional means of observation yield no results. Instead, scientists carefully detect the radiation released from the accretion disks, or the large gravitational waves that are released during the collision of two black holes — a phenomenon first confirmed by LIGO (a large-scale physics observatory designed to detect gravitational waves) in 2015. \n\nThese observations have revealed that black holes come in various sizes: \n\n· Stellar (3-100 solar masses) * \n\n· Intermediate (hundreds-thousands of solar masses) \n\n· Supermassive (millions to billions of solar masses) \n\n· Primordial (hypothetical remnants from the Big Bang). \n\n* 1 solar mass = 1.989×1030 kg \n\nThis wide variety of sizes leads scientists to believe black holes grow through various processes. The current leading theories involve either the black hole drawing in surrounding matter or merging with other black holes. While these ideas hold up when tested with models and indirect observations, a clear explanation still eludes physicists. \n\nA more mystifying theory comes from the famous scientist Stephen Hawking, who theorized in 1974 that black holes may not only grow, but also decay. This is possible through something known as Hawking Radiation, an occurrence where black holes create virtual particle pairs at the edge of their event horizon, due to quantum fluctuations. One of these particles falls into the singularity, while the other escapes as radiation, causing the black hole to shrink in size. This brings about the prospect that over an extended period, a black hole could potentially disappear. \n\nThe idea that something as immense and powerful as a black hole could vanish challenges our understanding of not only these abysses but also our understanding of the universe itself. It raises more questions than it answers that remain hidden from our senses, yet illuminated by the divine vision of mathematics, the language of the universe. \n\nAnd even then, these questions only scratch the surface of secrets these voids hide. \n\nOther notions—information paradox, the breakdown of quantum physics around singularities, or white holes, the opposite twins of black holes—continue to humble scientists, reminding us about how much we still have left to unveil. \n\nThese dark, mysterious, and terrifying enigmas test the limits of what we know, tugging at the very fabric of time, space, and reality as we know it. \n\nWe may never truly understand these cosmic chasms. \n\nBut we can try."

        "content": "Have you ever opened YouTube or Instagram to watch a few shorts or reels for just 5–10 minutes, only to find yourself still scrolling two hours later? It’s shocking how platforms like Instagram and YouTube are able to deliver videos so perfectly tailored to your interests. It almost feels like they know exactly what you want to watch. In reality, that’s machine learning at work, tracking which videos you spend the most time on and then pushing more content based on your viewing patterns. \n\nEvery time Netflix suggests your next binge, or your phone predicts the next word you are about to type, you're seeing machine learning in action. \n\nMachine learning is often a foreign concept to many, yet it is integrated into numerous applications we use daily. Various social media platforms, videos on YouTube, and even products on Amazon utilize machine learning. This subset of artificial intelligence has quietly positioned itself close into the center of our lives, enabling us to interact with it daily.\n\nThe realm of artificial intelligence includes numerous subfields, one of which being machine learning. Machine learning allows systems to actually learn patterns and correlations from data and make predictions and decisions based on what they receive. Machine learning can be used to analyze huge amounts of data to determine patterns or trends in an extremely short amount of time - in fact, the more amount of data the machine learning algorithm contains, the more likely its accuracy will increase. \n\nMachine learning is a learning process that is achieved through the implementation of machine learning models. These models are no more than mathematical formulas - usually complex ones which we don’t need to delve into. These models analyze large amounts of data to improve their prediction accuracy and performance over time without being explicitly programmed. A simple way to think about it is this: imagine a scenario where a small child must classify planes and cars. Rather than just instructing the child that planes have wings, a long body, a tail, and can fly, while cars are much smaller, have no wings or tail, and do not fly, the child is instead given hundreds or thousands of images of either cars or planes. Over time, as the amount of data grows, the child is able to recognize and detect these differences between the car and the plane. This is the heart of machine learning. The ML models learn from the data they’re given through two main learning processes. \n\nThe first method is supervised learning. In this method of learning, all of the data contains labels. Going back to the car vs. plane example, if a ML model was given this data and told to analyze it with supervised learning, all of the data would contain labels, such as “car” or “plane.” The model is able to easily identify which picture is a car or plane based on the label and, through this, is able to detect any differences between the car and the plane and classify accordingly. Numerous practical applications exist for this method of learning for ML models, including medical diagnosis, fraud detection, marketing, and more. \n\nThe second method is through unsupervised learning, which is the exact opposite of supervised learning. In unsupervised learning, labels do not exist for the data - indicating that when the data is passed to the model, the model does not know the labels. The ML model must be able to detect any hidden patterns, correlations, or relationships without any prior experience or examples. Imagine an adult working to analyze consumer spending behaviors. This adult mainly specializes in finding sets of items that are bought together or occur frequently together in consumer purchases. The adult would be that, the majority of the time, consumers buy bread and butter together at the store. Obviously, the relationships that must be determined are much more complex than the one just given - or else why would one need this learning method of machine learning? In this method, the model teaches itself the similarities, differences, and groupings within the dataset. Applications for this method of machine learning include clustering of people based on their types of behavior in different situations (e.g. purchasing, panic, etc.), aiding in customer segmentation for businesses, along with detections in cybersecurity, and even genomic data analysis. \n\nNow, ML models operate through a series of layers containing neurons. The first layer, called the input layer, receives the data. Through this data, the machine learning process is initialized. Next, the model contains one or more hidden layers, which is where core learning and pattern extraction occurs. The more hidden layers a ML model has, the “smarter” it becomes, allowing it to better extrapolate relationships in the data given in the input layer. A model with 10 hidden layers would be able to find distinct correlations in the data much better than a model with only one input layer. However, this model will also run slower than a model with 1 hidden layer due to an increase in training time. Finally, the last layer is the output layer, which consists of the model’s prediction on the data initially given in the input layer. \n\nModels usually operate on training and testing data. To provide accurate results, it is essential that the testing portion is wholly different from the training portion. During the training portion, the data enters the input layer and passes through the hidden layer. In the output layer, models incorporate a loss function. In this step, the loss function measures the model’s predictions against the actual value in supervised learning, while in unsupervised learning, the loss function measures how well the model was able to extrapolate relationships and correlations in the data. Based on these results, the model updates the hidden layer accordingly in order to improve its results on the next portion of the training dataset. \n\nThe testing portion includes data being passed through the input layer and analyzed by the hidden layer. This step is crucial as the training of the hidden layer functions indicate how well the model is able to detect relationships and make predictions on the data. Finally, a prediction is passed through the output layer. \n\nML models are not always 100% accurate - in fact they often are never 100% accurate. To achieve this accuracy, models must be completely right, which means that their hidden layer must be perfect. This is not always the case. To improve accuracy, one must have lots of data in order for the functions in the hidden layer to adjust themselves in the training phase, along with lots of hidden layers as well. By including these features, one can easily improve the accuracy of a ML model. \n\nMachine learning is no longer a futuristic concept - it’s currently being utilized by companies, organizations and researchers across the globe and has already positioned itself in the midst of our everyday lives. Amazon is able to push products towards us through these models, using our previous purchase history as the data. Most importantly, they are able to do this without any human intervention, highlighting the goal of building systems that can adapt and improve on their own. Even without labeled data, ML models are still able to detect anomalies and relationships in data. However, although ML may sound powerful, it is critical to understand its limitations and drawbacks as well. The utilization of machine learning wisely and efficiently is the future of our community.

        "content": "Chemical reactions are all around us. They’ve been occurring long before humans were created, long before even the earth existed. Ever seen iron rusting? That’s a chemical reaction. Tried mixing vinegar and baking soda together and seeing fizzing and bubbling? That’s also a chemical reaction. These reactions have been occurring for eternity and us humans have extracted various laws and principles governing these reactions. \n\nHave you ever seen a chemical reaction? Like H2(g) + I2(s) → 2HI(g)? If not, this is the notation for the reaction between hydrogen and iodine that creates hydrogen iodide. Essentially, a chemical reaction is the process of one or more substances chemically changing into another substance. Water freezing wouldn’t be a chemical change since the atoms making up the ice are still H2O - they’re just in a different form. However, iron rusting would be considered a chemical change as the chemical composition (which refers to which atoms are present) is different once the reaction is complete. In a chemical reaction, the substances on the left are called reactants, while the substances formed on the right are called products. \n\nNow, metals, since they have electrons to lose, tend to react with nonmetals, since nonmetals tend to gain electrons. This reaction usually forms an ionic bond between the two elements. An ionic bond is formed from the transferring of electrons. An example of an ionic bond would be NaCl(s). Sodium has 1 extra electron it would like to give away, while chlorine has 1 electron it would like to gain. As a result, these two elements form an ionic bond with each other. Ionic bonds tend to be extremely strong and brittle. They are almost always made of metals and nonmentals. \n\nHowever, elements and substances can often share electrons amongst themselves as well in order to maintain balance in their electron structure. These types of bonds are called covalent bonds and usually form between nonmetals. An example would be carbon dioxide, or CO2. Carbon and oxygen share their electrons in order to maintain stability. Covalent bonds are typically weaker than ionic bonds but are still strong nonetheless. \n\nAs the strength of the atomic bonds increases, substances tend to exist in solid or liquid states at room temperature because stronger bonds hold particles closely together. Conversely, weaker bonds or interactions result in substances that are more likely to be gases, as the particles do not stick together strongly and can move freely. \n\nNow, however, what you’ve been assuming now is that the substances making up the reactants of the reaction will always react when close together - but this is not the case for a myriad of reactions. Often, favorable reactions may display this phenomenon, but on the other hand, some reactions may need energy in order to complete. This classifies a reaction as either endothermic or exothermic. \n\nEndothermic reactions tend to require energy in order to start the reaction. The additional energy will cause the particles to collide with each other more frequently and, as a result, participate in the reaction. Endothermic reactions tend to be unfavorable. Energy may be released at the end of the reaction but that energy never crosses the initial amount of energy needed to be put in. \n\nThe exact opposite of an endothermic reaction is an exothermic reaction, which tend to release large amount of energy after the reaction has gone to completion. These reactions tend to be hugely favorable since more energy is released when the reaction is complete. However, this doesn’t mean that no energy is required to get the reaction running - it just means that the energy released from the reaction is larger than the amount of energy put into the reaction. \n\nIn short, just by physically mixing two things together does not mean a reaction occurs. But how do we know how much energy to put in? Well, chemists have a name for this one as well. Its name is called the activation energy. The activation energy details how much energy to put in to get a reaction going. This value is different for each and every reaction as each reaction is different. A reaction can only go to completion once the activation energy is met-  or else it will not run. \n\nNow, on the other side of the reaction, where the products form, you may also be thinking that once a reaction occurs, only products will be left over. But, since science can sometimes be tricky, this is not always the case either in some reactions. \n\nWhen reactions start, they have a rate of formation of products. It could be that they’re forming products at a rate of 5 milligrams per second, or 500 grams per minute. This rate of reaction determines how long it takes for a reaction to complete. Some reactions require less than a second, while others (including decay) may require years, and possibly even thousands and millions of years as well. An example would be the decay of xenon, which takes half a trillion times longer to complete than the age of the universe. \n\nAlso, many reactions don’t simply go one way. As products form, sometimes they react back to create the original reactants. This back-and-forth continues until the reaction reaches a balance called chemical equilibrium, where reactants and products coexist in stable amounts. This means that the reactants and products actually coexist together. But how do people actually determine how much is present at equilibrium? \n\nWell, they use K, the equilibrium constant. The value of K is different for every reaction and details the extent to which a reaction will proceed by indicating the ratio of products and reactants at equilibrium. Some reactants, when mixed together, go to completion and only the products are left. These reactions, however, do not go to completion, and when equilibrium is established, there are still both reactants and products remaining. A higher value of K indicates a high level of completion, as there are more products than reactants. A low value of K indicates that the concentration of the reactants is higher than the concentration of products. A value of 1 for K signifies that the concentration of products and reactants at equilibrium is equal. \n\nAn example of a reaction involving equilibrium is the formation of nitrogen monoxide, from O2(g)+N2(g)⇌ 2NO(g). The double arrow indicates an equilibrium reaction. For this reaction, oxygen, nitrogen, and nitrogen monoxide are present at equilibrium. \n\nChemical reactions are far more than just things mixing in a beaker — they are dynamic processes that shape everything from the air we breathe to the fuel that powers our lives. Whether fast or slow, simple or complex, reactions follow clear principles: they occur at specific rates, often reach equilibrium, and are governed by the conservation of mass and energy. \n\nUnderstanding how and why reactions happen gives us the power to design better medicines, cleaner energy sources, and smarter technologies. In the end, to study chemistry is to understand the invisible forces constantly at work in the universe, subsequently transforming matter, releasing energy, and sustaining life itself."

        "content": "Back when I was seven years old, I was fully convinced that a ghost was haunting my house. No, I never saw this ghost, but I knew it existed. Whether it was the whispering creak of the floor, ominous shadows that pranced inside my room, or even the soft thumping knocks on my door, the ghost was keeping me on my toes. The fact that I hadn’t seen this ghost yet terrified me, and infuriated my mom till the end. Her reasoning was always, “If you can’t see it, then how do you even know it’s there?” Back then, this argument usually sent me back upstairs, attempting, in vain, to fall back asleep. \n\nBut now, if my mom were to ask me this question (hypothetically, of course, because obviously I’m still not frightened by Hollowface, definitely not), I would most likely rebut by explaining that, if scientists had followed her logic, then we would still only have seven planets in our solar system— not eight. \n\nNeptune wasn’t discovered by coincidence— in fact, it wasn’t even initially discovered through direct observation using a telescope. The first-time scientists predicted Neptune’s existence in the 1800s was through rigorous math, an incredible breakthrough in the way we thought about the universe, but not extremely complicated when broken down. \n\nWhen a planet orbits the Sun, scientists can predict its exact orbital path using its mass, distance from the Sun, and proximity to other large objects (other objects’ gravitational force would pull the planet towards them, barely, slightly altering the orbital path). When scientists observed the orbit of Uranus, the seventh planet from the sun, they discovered a slight variation in the orbital path from what was predicted on paper. \n\nThe only plausible explanation for this would be the existence of another planet— about 17 times the mass of the Earth— that was pulling Uranus towards it, therefore altering its path around the Sun from what was theorized. \n\nThrough Newton’s laws and careful math, even though scientists couldn’t see this new planet, they knew it must exist. In 1846, the genius French mathematician, Urbain Le Verrier, calculated the approximate mass, position, and orbital path of this ghost planet. His predictions were so precise that he was able to give the astronomers at the Berlin observatory exact coordinates to the planet’s location in the sky. That night, when they swiveled their telescopes to his calculated point, they discovered that his coordinates were only off by a minuscule 1 degree, leading to the discovery of the eighth planet— Neptune, the ice giant. \n\nThis discovery gave us more than just a new planet to add to the poster site. It was the first time a celestial object had been found without direct observation— and proved that even unseen forces, like gravity, could be predicted by the vision of mathematics. \n\nAfter this revelation, scientists in the early 1900s also discovered deviations in the orbit of Neptune. Now that the scientists had a well-thought-out process, they were able to calculate the position of the ninth planet quickly. In 1930, a young astronomer named Clyde Tombaugh compared photographs of the night sky and discovered a faint, moving object— Pluto. \n\nThe funny part about this entire episode is that it was completely incorrect. It turns out that since Pluto is only 0.2% of the mass of Earth, its gravity wouldn’t have been able to be observed in or even affect Neptune’s orbit at all! The reason scientists believed that there was a deviation from its predicted path was due to observational errors coming from the satellite Voyager 2, not due to a huge planet that would tug on its orbit. That’s why the position of Pluto in Clyde’s photos didn’t match the predicted position— because Pluto’s gravitational field was too small to affect Neptune at all. In the end, Pluto’s discovery was due to a happy coincidence. \n\nAfter Pluto’s unfortunate ejection from planet status (now known as a dwarf planet), for years it has been accepted that there are only eight planets in the solar system— Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune…that is, up until now. \n\nRecently, scientists have noticed that objects in the Kuiper belt (KBO for short), an asteroid belt beyond the orbit of Neptune containing many icy bodies and dwarf planets (like Pluto), have been behaving strangely. Not only are their orbits offset from what is predicted, but they seem to be shepherding around a large object— even larger than Neptune. \n\nDue to this object’s distance from Neptune, it does not affect Neptune’s orbit despite its large size. In models and trails, a Ninth Phantom Planet would perfectly explain the irregularities in the orbits of the objects in the KBO. Other predictions, such as observational errors— like what happened with Pluto, a passing star affecting their orbit, or a large clustering of smaller objects that is creating a large gravitational field have been predicted, but so far, the most plausible explanation revolves around two leading theories. \n\nOne theory suggests the existence of a ninth planet that we haven’t been able to observe yet. The reason for this may revolve around its distance from Earth, which would make it appear incredibly dim; it may lie within a dense star field, making it hard to distinguish from other objects; or current telescopes may lack the required sensitivity or field of vision to spot such a slow-moving object. Despite these speculations, scientists still have no clear idea of why we haven’t been able to observe it yet. \n\nThe second theory is significantly more spine-tingling— the possibility of a black hole lurking within the Kuiper belt. This hypothetical black hole would only be the size of an apple, but still have an incredible gravitational pull— comparable to a huge planet. Luckily, this black hole wouldn’t cause much trouble for us due to its relatively miniscule size and distance from Earth, but it could throw the KMO in a state of disorder, causing some to bodies to be thrown off orbit and go careening into deep space; increase collisions inside the KBO; and potentially, if leading theories about black holes expanding through matter consumption are true, start growing large enough to affect Neptune. Once again, it’s extremely fortunate for us that even if this were true, it would take billions upon billions of years to accomplish, since the small size of KBO objects would prove too tiny for it to make any notable growth. \n\nAstronomers like Dr. Konstantin Batygin and Dr. Mike Brown— who first proposed Planet Nine— are collaborating with international teams using advanced observatories such as the Subaru Telescope atop Mauna Kea, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). They’re running massive computer simulations and carefully tracking orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects to narrow down where this mystery planet could be located. Every small shift in an asteroid’s orbit, every tiny gravitational oddity, every subtle distortion of an object, leads us one step closer to unveiling this enigma. \n\nThe discovery of this new object would serve as more than just another planet to add to solar system charts, but would force us to dig more deeply into the story of our universe. We’d gain clues on how outer planets are formed, why the Kuiper belt is shaped the way it is, and whether our solar system has had encounters with other stars in the past. It could even be the missing page that allows us to open a new chapter in our book of cosmic history. \n\nGoing back to my childhood delusions, even though I couldn’t see this ghost, in my head, all signs pointed to the fact that it was alive. Every creak, knock, and shadow just seemed like further evidence to solidify the fact that I was being haunted. Even though my mother’s question, “If you can’t see it, how do you know it’s there?” seemed so irrefutable at the time. But this same question has driven generations of scientists to look past the visible and into the unknown. \n\nIf we can detect a planet without seeing it, if using mathematics, we can map the pull of something beyond what we can observe…then what else could be out there? \n\nWhispering through the vacuum of space. \n\nDropping clues on its subtle existence. \n\nInvisible yet undeniable. \n\nWaiting."

        "content": "When’s the last time you hopped into a taxi? Or how about an Uber or Lyft? No matter what type of ride-hailing service you use, there's always that awkward silence as the driver cruises down the highway for 20 minutes. Sometimes you’ll even get a Moody Margret who honks every minute and swerves like she’s in Fast & Furious. \n\nProblems can arise anytime a human driver takes the wheel — so what happens if we make that driver a robot? \n\nCompanies, including Tesla and Waymo, are already invested in the technology. As of today, a small number of commercially available fully driverless taxis are ready for consumers in the US. 2 brands are merging ahead of the driverless taxi scene. Tesla Inc. is currently in the testing stage of its new autonomous taxi, the Robotaxi. Meanwhile, Waymo, an American autonomous driving technology company, is starting to operate with its ride-hailing service named Waymo One. \n\nHow do Driverless Cars Work? \n\nThink of a highly trained guide dog navigating a blindfolded person through a crowded city. In other words, that’s the job of an autonomous vehicle. Just as a guide dog can use its senses to navigate an area, AI systems within the vehicle utilize different types of methods. \n\nLidar Sensors: In order to measure distances and create detailed 3D representations of their environment, lidar sensors project a laser light onto objects. \n\nUltrasonic Sensors: These sensors are primarily used for parking the self-driving taxi. Think of how a bat uses echolocation. Bats shout, the sound bounces off a wall, and bats know how far the wall is by how fast the echo comes back. Ultrasonic sensors work the same way. They can calculate distance by using sound waves of frequencies above what humans can hear. \n\nRadar Sensors: Using radio waves to measure distance, speed, and sometimes direction of the vehicle. \n\nCameras function as the “eyes” of the autonomous vehicle. They can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as navigating pathways, interpreting traffic signals, monitoring the driver, and much more. \n\nThere are more specifics involved, but at the basis of it, driverless cars are built on these core sensors and code. \n\nSafety for Passengers \n\nAlthough companies are persistently refining this hardware and software, there is still much more room for improvement, especially when it comes to the safety of the passengers. Self-driving cars, on average, have more than twice as many accidents as human-driven cars. While regular vehicles have 4.1 crashes per million miles, self-driving cars have 9.1 crashes per million miles driven. \n\nThese vehicles are constantly operating off their training data. So when the world doesn’t match their training data, they struggle to perform even the most basic operations. A case in 2022 perfectly displayed this matter, as a self-driving car stopped while making a left turn and was hit by an oncoming car. Later in 2023, a self-driving car failed to recognize the other part of an articulated bus and ran into it. \n\nBy lowering overall fatalities and improving self-driving systems, passengers can feel safe at all times. \n\nWhen Will the First Commercial Driverless Taxi Reach Me At My Doorstep? \n\nWaymo, an American autonomous driving technology company, plans to roll out its autonomous ride-hailing service in Dallas by 2026. In Waymo’s testing phase, they are currently providing more than 250,000 paid trips every week with about 1,500 vehicles in populated cities such as San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. \n\nIn terms of Tesla’s take on driverless taxis, it’s still unclear when the official launch of the Robotaxi will be. However, as of now, Tesla has carried out numerous tests for the taxi, including a group of Robotaxis providing rides to paying passengers in Austin on June 22, 2025. Austin’s roads have become the stage for an epic driverless duel. Grab your popcorn: it’s Tesla vs. Waymo, and the race is just getting started: Who you choosin’? \n\nHow Much Does a Ride Cost? \n\nFinally, when it comes to cost, prices can vary for different autonomous taxi companies. For instance, a Waymo ride generally costs more than those of Uber and Lyft; Waymo rides cost an average of $20.43, which is about $5.99 more than an average Lyft ride and $4.85 more than an average Uber ride. Meanwhile, Tesla plans to go easier on people's wallets. As of now, Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin is offered at a flat rate of $4.20 per ride. \n\nEnvironmental Effect \n\nDo driverless taxis hurt or help the environment? A recent study suggests that half of new autonomous vehicles could be autonomous by 2050, and half of the entire vehicle fleet by the 2060s. Due to the fact that there is such a great push to go all-electric, these vehicles will be essential in creating a zero-emission future. Compared to conventional vehicles operating on fossil fuel, Self-driving cars generate very little emissions over their lifetime. \n\nThe future of transportation is just around the corner (No, literally, there may be a Robotaxi around your block, especially if you live in Austin), so it’s important to be ready. Hopefully, the next time you travel to work, you can sit back, relax, and enjoy your human-free taxi."

        "content": "Part 1: An International Rivalry \n\nEvery single day, a war is going on, resulting in trillions of casualties at the hands of highly specialized weapons. No, this isn’t some science fiction story— it’s real and it is happening all around you! However, both the attackers and the victims may not be what you think they are. \n\nBacteriophages are specialized types of viruses that only attack bacteria— and there are a lot of them. It’s been hypothesized that there are more bacteriophages than all other organisms combined. Whenever these specialized viruses attack bacteria, they insert their genetic code— single-stranded or double-stranded DNA/RNA— inside the bacteria, which essentially “hacks” the bacteria to make more copies of the virus. Once enough have been made, the bacteria are basically told to explode, a process called lysis, where the bacterial cell uncontrollably splatters apart, releasing hundreds to thousands of new phages, each ready to affect their next victim. But it turns out that a few bacteria have a special trick up their sleeve. \n\nNow, most of the bacteria infected by a bacteriophage are doomed from the start— but some get lucky. Maybe the virus couldn’t insert its genetic code properly, or the bacterium was able to defend itself. Either way, the bacteria now have a piece of viral genetic code that hasn’t been properly implemented into its DNA— think of it as a piece of malware that hasn’t been downloaded onto the bacterial laptop yet. So, what does the bacteria do? \n\nWell, it goes ahead and downloads the malware anyway! \n\nNow, at first, that sounds completely counterintuitive. But here comes the special weapon that the bacterium has. Unlike a virus, which puts its DNA/RNA wherever it wants, the bacterium instead inserts it into a specific location in its genome called a CRISPR region. This region exclusively serves the purpose of housing viral code from a bacteriophage that the bacteria have since survived an attack from. This code won’t be activated to make more viruses, but instead serves a much more important function for the bacteria’s long-term survival. \n\nNow, this process is similar to how vaccines work, which trains the immune system to respond to a pathogen much faster and with greater accuracy a second time than when it first attacks the body (stay tuned for a vaccine-related article soon!) Similar to this, bacteria will store the viral code, ready for when that same species attacks it again. When this happens, the bacterium uses these stored sequences to produce matching RNA molecules, which guide specialized proteins called Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins to the viral DNA. The Cas proteins then cut the viral DNA apart, neutralizing the threat. \n\nPart 2: When Pigs Glow \n\nCRISPR stands for “Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.” Marked by short sequences of DNA that repeat over long intervals, it is present in virtually every species of bacteria. But what exactly does that have to do with us? Since the first evidence for CRISPR in 1987 of E. coli bacteria was observed, researchers have published hundreds of articles about how this genetic tool not only enables bacteria to fend off viral threats, but also to accurately and efficiently edit their genetic code. And somewhere along the line, we started thinking, “What if we were able to do that?” \n\nSince the discovery of CRISPR, we have made increased progress in understanding how the process works, and mainly just observing it in bacteria. However, in 2013, CRISPR was revolutionized when the first demonstration of modifying mice and even human cells was made. Suddenly, the possibilities became endless. For the next decade or so, we have been able to engineer science fantasies from labs across the country. Inserting fluorescence genes into pigs to make them glow and engineering larger fish for better yields, however, are just the tip of the iceberg! \n\nFor example, those same pigs that were once a cooler version of a night-light are now being engineered to potentially grow human-compatible organs for transplants and save lives as a result. Cows and other livestock have started to be engineered to be resistant to many of the most common diseases that afflict them, potentially reducing the costs of animal pandemics on the global supply chain by billions of dollars in the future. And mosquitoes resistant to plasmodium— the protist that carries the deadliest pathogen-carried disease in the world, malaria— are being engineered to potentially create colonies of mosquitoes that cannot carry the disease, reducing malaria rates drastically worldwide. \n\nIt’s important to note that all of these examples are in their early experimental stages, and most aren’t released wild or available in the commercial supply chain. But they are real, and they exist thanks to CRISPR. But then that begs a much more important question: if we can so easily change the genes of whatever organism we want…then why not ourselves? \n\nPart 3: Let’s go Build-a-Baby! \n\nReactions ranging from awe to nervousness to outrage sparked when, in 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced the birth of twin girls whose genomes were edited with CRISPR. Up until that point, labs hadn’t even thought of genetic editing human subjects for a long time— remember that just editing a few random human cells had happened only 5 years ago. Violating a plethora of medical standards and health codes in the process, Jiankui was subsequently jailed and fined, alongside 2 associates. \n\nEthics committees condemned his actions— after all, note that to edit them, Jiankui had to take two very major risks. The first is that genetic editing can only be done to any organism at the stage of the embryo, where the “person” is just a small cluster of rapidly splitting cells, and even the slightest mishandling of the embryo could render it unviable. The second issue is that modifying a person’s entire genome at the germline level means that any errors that happen in their DNA would then be passed down to future generations. However, his actions did have some reason to them, as thanks to his intervention, both girls would be born immune to any HIV infection— an amazing result, but at what cost? \n\nOf course, we have been able to make experimental genetic therapies for human adults, targeting specific organs and disorders. In 2023, the first full regulatory approval was granted in the U.K. and U.S. for a CRISPR therapy to treat sickle cell disease, among other conditions. This is clear proof that treating genetic conditions using CRISPR could prove to be a valuable tool in saving lives. There are several implications of using CRISPR to implement genetic modifications for anything that has DNA-based ties, from cancer to alzheimers. But in the case of He Jiankui, he took it several steps ahead, changing an entire organism before they were even born. \n\nThis has led to concerns that in a few years, we will get the ability to make “designer babies”, kids that have specific genetic modifications that are made willy-nilly. Perhaps parents could get the ability to modify how their kids look, act, and think before they are even born, thanks to CRISPR. We could see things like a Build-A-Bear for kids— people picking and choosing the best parts to go into a kid, designing them to be a perfect 6-foot-tall, blond, athletic, intelligent student. But is it ethically right to use such a powerful tool on such superficial things that don’t matter much in the grand scheme of things? And is it morally okay to do all of this without the consent of the people they are modifying, fundamentally changing their lives forever? \n\nThere are so many things that we could still talk about, but it should be clear that CRISPR has the potential to save many lives in the future. Whether to develop organisms and important animals with genes for disease resistance to increase nutritional value, or to the development of cures for widespread genetic disorders, CRISPR has great potential to be used for good. It's up to us to not only use it to help as many people as possible, but also to regulate it in moderation, taking great care that we don’t abuse our power over this great tool of the future."

        "content": "It’s Halloween right now, and you just went trick-or-treating. You’re sweaty, tired, and hauling a big, fat load of candy—so close to just dropping it down and eating it all. And you do just that. Sitting down on a patch of grass, you dig into your pillowcase to find a big blue, king-size Crunch bar. Oh boy. It looks delicious. So, like any chocolate-loving kid, you tear apart the wrapper and bite into the bar. At first it’s good. Real good. It’s crispy, popping all over your mouth and silky smooth. But after a few seconds, it collapses into just crumbs and sugar. It’s gone. That’s what some scientists think will happen to the universe. A Big Crunch. \n\nBut to understand the end, we have to understand the beginning. The beginning for our universe lies within the Big Bang, or the first bite of the bar. Every single thing, time, space, matter, was all compressed into a singularity. “An infinitely dense, infinitely hot point.” Then something triggered. In a fraction of a second, existence itself was born, and the universe expanded faster than the speed of light, unstoppable and vast. \n\nAs the expansion cooled down, the universe worked its magic into creating particles, atoms, planets, stars, galaxies and a special something that breathes within us: life. The flash from beyond 13.8 billion years still echoes today in the Cosmic Microwave Background, a dim glow that remains from a baby universe. Gravity sculpted for eons, forming galaxies like ours, but the story doesn’t stop there. Something interesting was happening as reality was organizing itself. \n\nThe universe wasn’t only expanding, but accelerating. Why? It was because of the invisible push, also known as dark energy. Making up approximately 68% of the universe, it acts as a force that divides. Galaxies race away from each other while the universe stretches away like pizza dough every second. \n\nSo now comes the end. There could be either a crunch, a frozen treat, or a ripped piece of licorice waiting for us at the end of existence. A common theory is the Big Freeze, also known as the heat death of the universe. What if the universe continues to expand forever? Billions and trillions of years of expansion. Every star runs out of fuel, galaxies drift apart too far for interaction, and all that’s left is an empty, cold infinitely expanding space. \n\nAnother would be the Big Crunch, where dark energy weakens and gravity becomes the king, gaining control and pulling everything inward. Collisions, sparks, and heat. Space-time collapses on itself. Everything clusters back into the original point. A dramatic finish for the Universe. \n\nThe last and most violent death would be a Big Rip, where instead of gravity being king, its dark energy. And as it becomes stronger and stronger, it tears apart galaxy clusters, solar systems, planets, atoms, and space-time itself. The tear doesn’t stop until the universe is in shreds. \n\nSo what does this do with a Crunch bar? It’s a simple metaphor for saying how we live inside a cosmic candy, caught between the snap of its beginning and the crumble of its end."

        "content": "Is that a Penguin?! \n\nNo, but it kinda looks like a Parrot… \n\nThese are the Atlantic Puffins! A relatively small, yet hardy bird, these guys are often called “The Clowns of the Sea” — and for good reason! We will do a deep dive on everything there is to know about the Puffin — from where it lives, to what it eats, and so much more! \n\nWhere can I find them? \n\nPuffins are found throughout the icy regions of the northern hemisphere. If you are out looking for puffins, the best time to do so is during their breeding season, Late April to August. This is when large flocks of puffins come ashore to breed and nest, and you are best off traveling throughout isolated, rocky islands near shore or steep rock cliffs to find them. However, for the rest of the year, they are usually far out at sea and beyond human reach, spending this part of their lives throughout the oceans by themselves. \n\nIf you’re like me and live in the US, your best chances of seeing puffins are traveling up to Maine, where puffins will often nest across the shoreline, or on islands close by. However, they are more common as you travel further north, with large colonies ranging from hundreds to thousands of birds present in colonies that are scattered throughout Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia, Scotland, and especially Iceland, which reportedly has over half of the world’s Atlantic Puffins! \n\nWhat do they look like? \n\nAs we’ve joked around, puffins are kind of similar to how a penguin crossed with a parrot might look — but rest assured, these guys are unique from any other bird species! They carry black feathers that cover their back and arms, and white ones everywhere across the underside of the puffin’s body, which shield it from the harsh cold environment. Alongside the feathers, puffins sport colorful feet and beaks, striped with shades of grey, yellow, and bright orange. In terms of size, Atlantic Puffins are one of the smaller seafaring birds, typically around 11-12 inches long, 8 inches high, and a wingspan of anywhere from 19 to 25 inches (that’s longer than the puffin itself!). But hey, even if Atlantic Puffins may be a bit on the small side, I’m sure they still have a great personality that more than compensates. And guess what — they absolutely do! \n\nHow do they behave and act? \n\nAs previously mentioned, Atlantic Puffins spend a good chunk of their life entirely at sea. The average puffin will spend 2/3 of its entire 20-year lifetime at sea, usually living a solitary lifestyle by itself. Puffins will do everything from eat, sleep, and take care of themselves on the ocean. Throughout a typical day, a puffin will spend a good amount of its time preening itself, which is just a fancy way to say it keeps its plumage controlled and spreads oil throughout it that comes from its preen glands. This oil is what allows the puffin to remain semi-waterproof, enabling it to easily & smoothly propel itself through the water as it swims. Actually, instead of “swimming” like a fish might, puffins often use the waves to propel themselves, enabling them to surf to their next meal! \n\nHowever, the story is entirely different during the breeding season. As spring begins, mature puffins (typically at least 4-5 years old) return to land — usually back to the colony where they were raised as young chicks — much like salmon that travel to their nesting site when they breed. Puffin “nests” aren’t like your typical bird nest; instead, these areas are closer to holes that are made by digging up a chunk of land and vegetation, in which the eggs are laid. Both genders have specific tasks in taking care of the eggs and chicks: males spend more time guarding and taking care of the nest, while the female spends more time incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. \n\nWhat do they eat? \n\nSpeaking of meals, a puffin's diet is almost entirely composed of small fish, ranging from herring, sandeels, hake, and capelin. However, a puffin may occasionally eat small crustaceans and other invertebrates if food is scarce in an area. Puffins typically hunt for food by flying very close to the ocean surface, sometimes at speeds of up to 50 mph. When it finds food, it lands in a pretty interesting way — since there is no land for it to latch onto and properly land on, most puffins will simply belly flop as they land on the ocean! Once they have caught and eaten enough, they will usually take off by flapping their wings rapidly as they skim the water’s surface, gaining momentum until they can fly again and find another place to repeat the cycle all over again. \n\nPredators & Conservation \n\nThanks to their small size and being isolated on small, barren islands or scattered throughout the ocean, puffins don’t have many predators. Being separate from the main masses allows them to remain safe from creatures such as dogs, cats, weasels, and foxes. At the ocean, predators come in from above or below. Larger birds such as the Great Suka can often attack puffins mid-flight, while seals and even some sharks have been able to eat puffins underwater. \n\nDespite these natural threats, the biggest threat to puffins is, well, us. In 2015, the Atlantic Puffin’s conservation status was recently changed from Least Concern to Vulnerable, a sign of declining puffin populations throughout the world. Ocean pollution, such as oil spills, has led to great losses of puffin habitat throughout much of Scandinavia, while climate change has caused puffins to become restricted to places that are still cold enough for their lifestyle, as glaciers and ice caps continue to melt. With all of these factors, current trends estimate that the European population of puffins will decline by 50–79% between 2000 and 2065. \n\nFortunately, there have been significant efforts to revive Puffin populations worldwide - and many of them are seeing great progress! Hunting puffins used to be a popular pastime & way to get food throughout the 20th century and earlier, but many countries, such as Iceland, have now outlawed the practice. Additionally, organizations such as SOS Puffin have been created to revitalize puffin populations among islands that used to have breeding colonies but currently do not. Other efforts include cleaning up pollution and other waste throughout oceans and puffin breeding grounds, and efforts to reintroduce Puffins to other areas across the world. \n\nIn the end, Atlantic Puffins are more than just “clowns of the sea” — they’re tough, colorful little survivors braving icy waters and rocky cliffs. Let’s hope our efforts help keep these charming birds around for generations to come!"

        "title": "The Best Studying Strategy",

        "content": "Have you ever just blanked during a test? If you haven’t, you're in luck, but I wasn’t as fortunate. I still remember sitting in my BC Calculus test, sweat dripping down my forehead as I stared at the questions. No matter how hard I tried, the math just wasn’t coming to me. I had spent hours rereading my notes and practicing problems, desperate to understand formulas and concepts, but when it mattered most, nothing seemed to stick. Now, before any big math test, that memory haunts me. I don’t ever want to relive the same nervousness and fear again— and so I found a better way to actually retain what I’m studying.\n\nActive recall is a concept that scientists and researchers have been studying extensively for a very long time. Studying using flashcards, summaries, and rereading notes only puts the information into your head. However, what many students forget is that test-taking involves a combination of two processes: retaining information and retrieving information. The methods that most people follow only involve the first process of retaining information.\n\nSo, what do you need to do on the day of the exam? Certainly not the first process!\n\nDuring a test, you need the second process, the process of retrieving information. And that is the essence of active recall.\n\nActive recall is the art of recollecting information from your brain. By practicing this process, information can be retained more easily in your head. Thinking about this process through neuroscience and other brain-related fields, retaining information fosters the development of neural connections in the brain, but these connections are weak. Over time, these connections will break, and one starts to forget information they learned previously. However, research has shown that active recall not only maintains that connection for a longer period of time, but also strengthens that connection as well. Practicing active recall allows a student to retain information more easily, since their neural connections are much stronger.\n\nWhen you actively recall something, your brain is not just pulling a memory off a mental shelf. Instead, it’s rebuilding it from the ground up. Each time you do this, the neurons involved fire together, strengthening the pathway between them through a process called long-term potentiation. This means the next time you need that piece of information, the signal travels faster and more efficiently. Without recall, these connections slowly weaken. This is a phenomenon first mapped out by Hermann Ebbinghaus in the late 19th century as the forgetting curve. Active recall essentially acts as a workout for your brain, keeping those connections strong and resistant to fading, while long-term potentiation represents the muscle growth that occurs afterward.\n\nNow, active recall doesn’t just help you remember, but also changes how you think. The repeated act of retrieval trains your brain to navigate your mental library more quickly. Over time, this improves not only memory retention but also the speed of recall. This is why experts in any field often seem like they have instant access to knowledge. It’s just because their neural pathways have been reinforced so many times that retrieval feels effortless.\n\nMoreover, active recall sharpens problem-solving skills. When you recall information without prompts, you learn to connect ideas in novel ways, strengthening not just isolated facts but also the relationships between them. This makes it easier to apply knowledge in unfamiliar contexts,  whether that’s diagnosing a patient, composing music on the spot, or improvising in a foreign language.\n\nThis process is useful in almost every field, from musicians having to skillfully play their instruments, to doctors recalling symptoms, and even language learners and linguists recalling words. Everyone naturally does active recall, but by amplifying the usage of active recall, one can retain much more information than another person who passively uses active recall for everyday tasks.\n\nActive recall is not just a technique for students or professionals, but a fundamental process our brains use every day to navigate the world. When you try to remember someone's birthday, recall directions to a place you haven’t visited often, or attempt to cook a recipe you haven’t cooked in months, you are using active recall. The more often you engage in this process intentionally, the stronger and more accessible these memories become.\n\nIn a fast-paced world full of information overload, the ability to retrieve important details quickly and accurately is essential. Active recall trains your brain to be that superpower. It helps you cut through distractions and surface the knowledge that matters most, exactly when you need it.\n\nSo whether you’re mastering a craft, learning a new language, or simply wanting to stay sharp as you age, embracing active recall can make a meaningful difference. It turns memory from a passive storage room into an active, dynamic library that is ready to provide answers, inspire creativity, and solve problems on demand.\n\nUltimately, active recall reminds us that memory isn’t static. It’s alive, shaped and reshaped by how often and how deeply we engage with what we want to remember. By making recall a conscious habit, you can unlock the full potential of your brain and keep your mind agile for a lifetime.\n\nSo the next time you are taking a monster of a test, feel at ease knowing that you have, hopefully, practiced active recall (It will drastically improve your score, like my D to an A in BC)."

An array of snacks awaits you on the table, the TV glows mutely, and your blanket wraps around you like a cocoon.\n\n56…57...58…59, and then the clock chimes. You swivel your head to the TV, eyes wide as the “New episodes” button pops up on the screen.\n\nThe new season of Ninjago has finally arrived!\n\nYou reach for the remote, but clench empty air. You look around wildly, heart sinking, until you see it at the edge of the sofa— just a sliver away— every muscle tenses. Your hand outstretched, you imagine bending reality, summoning every ounce of your brain to make it levitate toward you. But it stays there, placid, indifferent, and unmoving.\n\nAnd at that moment, your greatest wish is that you were a psychic.\n\nA common myth is that “humans only utilize about 10% of their brains. So-called “psychics” or individuals with supposed supernatural abilities are often credited with having unlocked the rest of the 90%, allowing them to perform acts usually considered impossible. This idea has inspired books, movies, and even real-life pursuits, with some people dedicating their entire lives to achieving this state through extensive research, performance enhancers, and meditation.\n\nBut reality is far less mystical— and far more mesmerizing. Neuroscientists have already explored this question in incredible detail. The truth is, humans use 100% of their brains even in the simplest of tasks. The act of picking up a cup activates motor regions, sensory pathways, and coordination centers— lighting up far more than a fraction of the brain. And that’s just for something as ordinary as lifting a cup of water.\n\nIn more complex tasks— playing sports, solving math problems, or creating art— brain activity goes into hyperdrive. Multiple regions fire in complex patterns, weaving thought, memory, and motion into a seamless action. Forget leaving 90% of our brains silent; even our everyday lives require the full orchestration of the human brain!\n\nFor those who fall into the 10% myth, the reason is often pop culture, books, and movies fantasizing about surreal power like telekinesis, perfect memory, superhuman intelligence, or even psychic abilities. These unearthly abilities lure people into believing what usually would be considered ridiculous.\n\nThis belief has led some to spend years chasing a nonexistent high. Meditation, drugs, extensive counseling, and so-called performance enhancers are often framed as ways to “unlock” the rest of the human brain capacity. But once again, the truth is very different. Even though practices like meditation and yoga don’t reveal hidden brainpower, they do provide other benefits that can lead to better productivity and mental health, such as stress reduction, improved focus, and better regulation of emotions. Performance enhancers, on the other hand, don’t just magically unlock the rest of your brain. They use the same portion of the brain but temporarily alter the brain’s chemistry— boosting alertness, reducing fatigue, or enhancing reaction time— often at the cost of long-term side effects.\n\nNow, if these facts are there, then why do people still fall into this trap? The lure stems from social media. Often, popular apps such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube endorse these wondrous effects. Many of the individuals on these apps either do it for views or are extremely misinformed, often only learning a small portion of the bigger picture that conforms to their beliefs. Psychologically, people believe this due to their deep desire for potential. Humans love the idea that we are just one secret away from greatness, and that the human limit isn’t capped. The myth gives people hope that something magical is waiting— even if science tells a very different story.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t the only fantasy people fall for due to this craving. Other examples include:\n\n· Hidden Sixth Sense – Many people believe there exists a dormant extra sense that some people have to a greater extent than others. In reality, it’s just our other senses adapting along with our brains, giving us a false “sixth sense”.\n\n· Unused Muscles – The claim that humans only use a fraction of our muscular strength, and if fully unlocked, some could even lift bulldozers. While it’s partially true that our brain limits our raw strength to protect the body from extra injury, we use far more than the myth suggests.\n\n· Dreams hold secrets – Many inaccurately theorize that dreams are secret messages about the future, when in fact, even though dreams can reflect emotional states and memories, they do not blueprint the future.\n\nAt their core, all these myths hook us the same way: they whisper that this isn’t our limit and that we are more than we appear to be. The right switch, pill, or practice will take us beyond what we are now.\n\nBut these myths go past just fun romanticization of life, and seep into something much more dangerous. Many waste their entire lives chasing the unreachable, spending millions of dollars, and investing in fake products. Online, products like brain enhancement pills (pills claiming to give genius-level focus and brainpower) or Binaural beats apps (boasting audio frequencies that will “unlock” the other 90%) all promise the same, easy way out of work. Claiming that their product is the answer, for astonishing amounts of money, for a simple product that only provides the illusion of increased intellect.\n\nEven worse, some of these products are outright dangerous, and neglect to include these ads or promotions.\n\nIn a huge event where a drug called Piracetam was advertised as one of these so-called “smart drugs,” disastrous consequences followed. Originally, Piracetam was prescribed in small amounts for memory loss, dementia, and learning problems, but in large quantities, this drug can do more harm than good. Side effects such as trouble sleeping, anxiety, depression, or drowsiness plagued buyers of this drug, causing many cases of hospitalization.\n\nAfter further digging, it was found that large amounts of this drug, in unsafe amounts, were illegally being sold without FDA approval. The operation took years to shut down, and even to this day, people continue to fall for these tricks.\n\nThis incident is just one of the hundreds of incidents involving a falsely advertised drug. Taking advantage of human greed, sellers rake in millions off these products, while buyers are left with nothing except ruined lives.\n\nTo avoid these malicious products, follow these steps:\n\n· Check regulations – Only buy FDA-approved products or another trusted medical authority.\n\n· Ask a doctor – Never buy a marketed drug without asking a certified doctor, especially if it’s marketed as a performance enhancer.\n\n· Trust your gut – Remember, if it’s too good to be true, then it most likely isn’t true!\n\n· No cutting corners – Sleep, exercise, a balanced diet, and meditation work just as well, if not better. Don’t take the easy way out with a magical pill!\n\nNow, there you are again, stretching your hand, desperately wishing you could simply make the remote shoot towards your fingers. A bead of sweat slowly forms on your forehead, eyes burning with focus, and you twitch slightly.\n\nTHERE IT WAS! Did it just move a little?! It seems to be shifted a bit towards the right!\n\nDespite your overactive imagination, you sigh, getting out of your warm fortress, trudging to the remote, with a lingering feeling of disappointment.\n\nMaybe psychics weren’t real after all.\n\nBut at least reality had Ninjago on Netflix."

        "content": "Picture this— you walk through a doorway to a Burger King. What do you see? A floor that REALLY needs to be swept; a worker who just wants to go home at the counter; and, of course, that famous Burger King crown that you get after choosing what your delicious meal is. Now, this is just a description of your average Burger King that you can find off practically every American road, and I’ll be the first to say this, it isn’t exactly the most alluring restaurant out there. Yet, every year, Burger King reels in billions of dollars in sales. Why is this? Not because their food is so good that you HAVE to come back (well, that’s subjective), not because their commercials are mindblowing. Not even because their logo is the best franchise logo out there! In fact, the reason why restaurants, like Burger King, continue to bring back customers again and again might actually be because of engineering. Sounds crazy, right?\n\nBut first, let’s set one thing straight… What exactly do we mean by “engineering”? That’s such a broad word, and it really can apply to anything. Biomedical, chemical, mechanical, literally anything else, but what we are talking about today dives into one specific subset that is quite overlooked. Industrial Engineering. Industrial engineering is essentially an entire process of making things easier for humankind. Think of refurbishing an entire house to walk around more comfortably, analyzing data to make a computer program, or even making entire international flight paths take less time. Restaurant franchises use this entire process of Industrial Engineering to make their restaurant more “inviting” to potential consumers. This entire concept of industrial engineering has been used so much by fast food companies that it has really branched out into two main ideas: making their infrastructure more welcoming to potential consumers and heightening the experience that consumers will have when they choose to dine at the restaurant.\n\nFirst Strategy: Architecture\nI don’t know whether you guys have noticed it or not, but I certainly have! In recent years, fast food places like McDonald’s, Burger King, Dairy Queen, Taco Bell, and even Long John Silver's have all scrapped the traditional, whimsical, and almost fairytale-like structures for more corporate, sleek designs for their buildings. Now, at first glance, you may think that this type of architecture leads to fewer people enjoying fast food, and to be honest, I thought that as well. But it has actually worked in their favor! Take McDonald's as an example. A fast food restaurant that is characterized by its famous golden arch, play places, and the famous clown Ronald McDonald. Yet, in the mid-2010s, they threw it all away, rehauling hundreds of franchises across the nation into sleek buildings with a palette of earthy colors. Furthermore, the outside of the franchises was changed from their traditional golden arches and slanted roof to something totally different. The new McDonald's almost looked like an actual office building, a real corporate feel. And sure, while they may have lost some customers who were looking for the nostalgic golden arches and the lovable Ronald McDonald, they introduced an entire new audience to the chain. The newer Earthy colours, and the corporate feel attracted customers who needed to go somewhere to work, get on a study call, or even have job interviews. And sure enough, all the customers who came to the franchise to engage in “serious business” bought Big Macs, Fries, and all the Chicken Nuggets you could imagine. In fact, McDonald's reported sales lifts of up to 10% after the majority of their franchises switched to this newer business look, and they weren’t the only ones. Burger King reported sales lifts of 11.9%, and Taco Bell astonishingly saw a 60% uplift in digital sales, thanks to their promotion of online ordering through their sleek new setup. These moves taken by fast food companies not only show their attitude towards shifting to new, modern architecture, but also a GENIUS new method at attracting new customers through industrial engineering. By making the outside appearance more appealing, consumers poured through their doors!\n\nSecond Strategy: Aesthetics\nYet, none of the architecture changes above would actually matter if the customers had a bad experience, right? That’s exactly correct, but don’t fret, because many fast food businesses also use industrial engineering to make sure that their potential customers get the best experience possible. But wait, how exactly does this happen? Let’s take a trip to Canton, Massachusetts, an unassuming town of around 24,000 people. In that town lies the headquarters of Dunkin’ Donuts. If you go to one of the many franchises in the area, what do you see? Not just the counter, or the oven where they make hashbrowns, breakfast sandwiches, or donuts, but also a seating area with a discreet intention. You see, Dunkin’, as well as so many other fast-food establishments, change their inner floor layouts, shifting tables around, buying new furniture, installing kiosks to order remotely, and even changing the lighting, all to make eating within that franchise more palpable. If you yourself walk into a random Dunkin’ Donuts and take a glimpse of your surroundings, you might actually be tempted to take a seat, just because of how comforting the seating looks. And that’s exactly what fast food establishments aim to do. Regardless of food quality, advertisements, and even social media sponsorships, in order for fast food places to function, they NEED to be appealing to the people who WANT to order. Industrial engineering helps them do just that, especially in terms of indoor decorations and layouts.\n\nSo, in the grand scheme of things, what does this actually mean? With all honesty, after writing this article, I myself will probably be hungry and order a 6-inch veggie delight from Subway, but just remember this. When you, or literally anyone else in the US, go to a fast food establishment, realize that engineering is a key tool that fast food places use to market themselves to potential consumers. Even if their main focus is to sell food that comes out fast, they try to make you happy!"
